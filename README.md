# Unreal Engine 5 Practice

This is a practice project for me and some friends to hone our skills using Unreal Engine 5. The goal of this project is to get faster and better in UE5 in preparation for the Ubisoft Game Competition happening in spring 2024. As the lead programmer of the team, I will be focusing on gaining a better understanding of backend systems and trying to create streamlined workflows for my teammates to use effectively. 

GOALS
-----
* Responsive/Emergent AI Behaviors
* Fluid and Easy 3rd Person Movement
